- Summarize a document: Create a structured summary of the attached document using only the provided content. Start with a two sentence overview that captures the main purpose, audience, and outcome. Then provide five to seven bullets that cover the most important points, including key decisions, metrics, timelines, and stakeholders if mentioned. Add a short section for risks or open questions and clearly label any missing information. If the document includes sections or headings, preserve that structure in your summary to improve traceability. Include a brief methodology note that explains how the summary was derived, such as which sections or evidence were prioritized. If the text contains quotes, use one short quote to anchor a critical claim. Keep the tone professional and neutral, and avoid external facts or assumptions. End with a brief summary of next steps or recommended actions if they are explicitly stated, and a note on what evidence is needed if they are not. If no actions are present, say so. The goal is a premium, executive ready summary that is concise, accurate, and easy to scan.
- Compare two documents: Compare the attached documents with a structured, narrative synthesis. Provide a short overview of each document, then map overlaps, contradictions, and unique claims. Identify differences in scope, time period, stakeholders, and any definitions that appear to conflict. Call out supporting evidence for each critical difference, and note where either document is vague, missing data, or makes assumptions. End with a concise table-like section that lists alignments, divergences, and unresolved questions. If you see potential reconciliation paths, propose them as actionable next steps. Keep the output professional, neutral, and precise, and avoid filling gaps with external knowledge. Use complete sentences and keep the language clear enough for executives, but detailed enough for analysts. When a comparison depends on missing details, explicitly mark it as unknown and explain what evidence would resolve it.
- Draft an executive brief: Create a polished executive brief based solely on the provided materials. Start with a one paragraph summary that captures the core intent, current status, and immediate outcome. Then provide a section on highlights, a section on risks and blockers, and a section on recommended next steps. If the document contains names, dates, or metrics, surface them, and clarify any time-sensitive dependencies. When the material is unclear, flag the ambiguity and explain the impact on decision making. Keep the voice formal, concise, and leadership-ready. Avoid jargon unless it appears in the source. Close with a short set of questions an executive should ask to validate readiness, including ownership, cost, timeline, and compliance concerns.
- Extract action items: Extract action items from the provided content and present them as a clear, ordered list. For each action, include the owner if named, the due date if stated, and any dependencies, inputs, or approvals required. If an action implies work but is not explicitly assigned, label it as unassigned and suggest the likely role based on context. Capture implicit follow ups, decisions required, and any tasks that block delivery. Add a brief summary at the top with the total number of actions and the most urgent item. If dates are missing, estimate relative urgency by analyzing deadlines or sequence cues, but clearly mark them as inferred. Keep the wording concise and actionable, and avoid inventing tasks that are not supported by the source.
- Risk scan: Perform a risk scan using only the supplied context. Identify operational, technical, legal, financial, and reputational risks. For each risk, provide a short description, a potential impact, a likelihood rating (low, medium, high), and the evidence or quote that triggered the risk. Highlight any assumptions or missing data that could increase exposure. Then add a mitigation section with suggested controls, owners to consult, and a timeframe to address each risk. If a risk depends on unknowns, mark it clearly and describe the information needed to validate it. Keep the output structured and terse, like a risk register, while still readable for executives. Do not add external facts; if the document is silent on a topic, say so.
- Meeting recap: Summarize the meeting notes into a crisp, professional recap. Start with a one paragraph overview capturing purpose, participants, and outcomes. Then list decisions made, action items with owners and dates, and any open questions. If there were disagreements or unresolved items, note them and the next step to resolve. Include key metrics or commitments and highlight any changes to scope or schedule. If the meeting referenced documents or tasks, capture the references. Keep the recap under clear headings and maintain a neutral tone. When details are missing, label them as unknown rather than guessing. End with a brief readiness statement that says whether the team can proceed and what is required before the next checkpoint.
- Decision log: Build a decision log from the provided content. List each decision with the decision statement, date, decision makers, rationale, and downstream impact. If a decision is implied but not explicit, label it as inferred and explain the evidence. Capture dependencies, tradeoffs, and rejected alternatives if mentioned. Provide a short summary at the top with the number of decisions and the most critical decision. When dates or owners are missing, mark them as unknown and note the missing evidence. Keep the format consistent and easy to scan. Avoid external reasoning beyond what is stated in the material, and do not add decisions that are not supported by the text.
- Timeline synthesis: Synthesize a timeline of events from the provided materials. Identify dated events, milestones, approvals, launches, and key dependencies. For each entry, include the date, event description, owner or team, and any referenced artifacts. If dates are relative or ambiguous, note the uncertainty and the best available ordering. Add a short section for upcoming milestones and another for overdue items. If the timeline exposes gaps, list the missing dates and the data needed to complete the schedule. Keep the timeline clear and ordered, with concise descriptions that preserve the original meaning. Do not invent dates or infer events without evidence.
- Compliance checklist: Convert the document into a compliance checklist. Identify applicable requirements, controls, or obligations described in the text. For each item, provide a checklist statement, evidence needed, current status (pass, fail, unknown), and the owner or function responsible. If the document includes policies, regulations, or standards, align the checklist items to those sections. Where evidence is missing, mark the status as unknown and specify the exact proof required. Add a brief summary of overall compliance posture and the highest risk gaps. Keep the language formal and audit friendly, and avoid introducing external requirements not mentioned in the source.
- Stakeholder map: Create a stakeholder map from the provided content. Identify all people, teams, and external parties, and classify them by role, influence level, and responsibilities. Include their stated goals, concerns, and decision authority. If conflicts or dependencies exist between stakeholders, describe them. Provide a summary of primary stakeholders, secondary stakeholders, and observers. For each stakeholder, note the evidence from the text and any missing information required for clarity. Close with recommendations for engagement, communication cadence, and escalation paths, using only what can be justified from the source material. Keep the structure easy to scan, and avoid assumptions not grounded in the document.
- Metrics summary: Extract and summarize all metrics, KPIs, targets, and performance indicators mentioned. For each metric, include the current value, target, time range, data source if provided, and any trend notes. If a metric is referenced without a value, mark it as missing and call out the gap. Provide a short analysis of what the metrics imply about performance, risks, or trajectory, based strictly on the text. Highlight any inconsistencies between metrics or definitions. End with a compact list of questions needed to validate the numbers. Keep the output precise, numerical where possible, and refrain from external calculations unless directly supported by the data.
- Counterpoint review: Provide a critical review of the content that surfaces risks, counterarguments, and blind spots. Identify where claims lack evidence, where assumptions are fragile, and where alternative interpretations could change the conclusion. For each concern, cite the relevant statement and describe the potential impact if it is incorrect. Add a section for unresolved questions and propose what data would validate or invalidate each claim. Keep the tone professional and constructive, not adversarial. Avoid external knowledge, and do not invent facts. Close with a short recommendation on whether the argument is decision ready, and what minimum evidence is required before proceeding.
- Client-ready FAQ: Generate a client-ready FAQ derived strictly from the provided context. Create concise questions and clear, non-technical answers that a client would ask about scope, timeline, cost, risks, and expected outcomes. If the content contains constraints, prerequisites, or dependencies, address them in the answers. Avoid jargon unless it appears in the source, and keep answers under a few sentences each. Include a short section for unresolved questions, stating what information is missing to answer them. Keep the tone confident, polite, and client friendly, and avoid making promises not supported by the material.
- Email draft: Write a professional client email summarizing the current status from the provided materials. Start with a polite greeting and a one sentence purpose. Provide a short progress update, key achievements, and any risks or blockers. List clear next steps with owners and proposed dates, and include any decisions required from the client. If there are open questions, include them as bullet points. Keep the tone calm, confident, and transparent, and avoid introducing new facts. End with a courteous close and a call to confirm the next meeting or approval step. Keep the length appropriate for a client update, and ensure the message is easy to scan.
